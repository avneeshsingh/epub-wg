## Major planned milestones (from the charter)

The names of the official WG documents differ from the ones listed is in the charter. Some documents from the charter, have been merged or split. The transformation has been made in two steps:

1. merge of EPUB 3.X, Packages 3.X, Content Documents 3.X, Open Container Format 3.X, and Media Overlay 3.X into one document, removing the duplications;
2. separation the issues on Reading Systems Conformance into a separate document.

These two steps resulted in the EPUB 3.3 and the EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems documents. The EPUB Accessibility document remained, in this respect, unchanged. All these changes were purely editorial
