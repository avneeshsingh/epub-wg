### 1. Meeting Agenda 2020-09-17 https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-epub-wg/2020Sep/0001.html
{: #section1}

**Wendy Reid:** Let's start!  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** Why we are here - make epub 3 a standard  
… this is the first Japan friendly time meeting, we will alternate times  
… [Japanese]  
… [More Japanese]  

**Wendy Reid:** Roadmap: goal is publish and produce a new epub revision  
… Currently epub 3.3, may change  
… Also want to deliver a complete end to end test suite for epub  
… We don't have that now, and it is a requirement for w3c  
… That will be a lot of work  
… As we write the tests we will revise the spec to clarify or fix discovered issues  
… Also doing an update to the a11y spec  
… By 2025 all books published in Europe must be accesible  
… Need to focus on fixed layout content that is not accessible now  
… Also may look at html5, CSS 3, etc  
… Want to keep everyone happy  
… At the end of the charter (2.5 years) hope to make epub 3 a full rec  
… Will need to publish a first public working draft, will happen in the next few weeks  
… Basically the current spec with some cleanup  
… By CR we need the tests  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** [Translation from Canadian to Japanese]  
… thanks you  

**Wendy Reid:** Process - two calls  
… a NA/Europe call (late night in Japan)  
… Another morning Japan/evening NA  
… for the meetings that are at a terrible time where you are there is no need to attend  
… We two mailing lists, private and public  
… private is used for things like sharing our zoom link  
… Most work will actually be done on github  
… You will need an account, so get one if you don't have one  
… You can link your github to w3c account on your profile page - please do that  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/epub-wg](https://github.com/w3c/epub-wg)

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://github.com/w3c/publ-epub-revision](https://github.com/w3c/publ-epub-revision)

**Wendy Reid:** Two links posted. epub-wg is for admin and planning.  
… the second one is for the documents  
… Any epub issues will go in publ-epub-revision  
… This is the same repo as we used for the CG  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** [More translation to Japanese]  
… explaining github stuff  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/)

**Wendy Reid:** IRC - send your nickname to Ivan so he can match them to real names for the minutes  
… CEPC is our code of conduct. Read it, learn it, know it! All meetings are covered there, in person and remote, as well as github comms  
… Scribes. They are awesome. We will have a rotation list, please contact Wendy to be added to the list. It is a lot of fun  
… Decision process: we will need to decide things  
… A proposal will be put in the IRC channel, we vote with +1/0/-1  
… We will wait a week before finally deciding to give people in other timezones a chance to vote/comment  
… You can respond via email or in the next meeting if you want to record a vote  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** [Translating about process]  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Please explain how to ask questions, etc  

**Wendy Reid:** Use q+ in IRC. q- removes you.  
… Make sure to "present+" when you enter the meeting  

**Daihei Shiohama (塩濱大平):** Want to give an example  
… Showing off q+  
… [Japanese] q+ [more Japanese]  

**Tzviya Siegman:** present+  
… More IRC coolnesses  
… type "/me xyz" to send a comment that will not go to the minutes  
… You can add stuff after q+ to remind you off why you went on the queue  

**Wendy Reid:** There are newbie docs that discuss IRC basics  

> *Wendy Reid:* [https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/WorkMode/newbie](https://www.w3.org/publishing/groups/epub-wg/WorkMode/newbie)

**Wendy Reid:** github is the best place to discuss things  
… don't wait for meetings, post to github  
… English is the operating language of the group, but if you want to post technical comments in your own language that is fine, Wendy will get them translated  
… Introductions, no need to scribe  
… Thank you everyone!  
… Versioning was discussed in the last meeting, starting at 3.3, that could change  
… As mentioned, decisions will take a week so everyone can participate  
… Questions?  
… Next agenda with better dates next Wednesday
