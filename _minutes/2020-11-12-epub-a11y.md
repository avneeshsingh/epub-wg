**Avneesh Singh:** welcome to the first meeting of the a11y taskforce  
… focus of our call is to figure out work items  

> *Ben Schroeter:* can't access the zoom link in the invite. is there another to try?

**Avneesh Singh:** exciting to finally be moving to the next version of the spec  
… the spec should go to CR in nov 2021  
… FPWD should be in Feb 2021  
… today let's just discuss what we want to cover in this roughly 1 year, which are must items, and which are nice-to-have  
… i thought we might have these calls every 2 weeks  

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* +1

**Avneesh Singh:** this golden time slot is so popular, it might be hard to increase the frequency of calls to every week  
… we can revisit this later, if necessary  
… also, should we have a separate issue tracker for a11y? We will keep the same issue tracker as the epub spec wg for now  

> *Avneesh Singh:* [https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/)

**George Kerscher:** will there be a specific label for the a11y issues?  

**Avneesh Singh:** yes
