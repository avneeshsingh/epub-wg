### 1. EPUB A11y and the EUAA
{: #section1}

**Avneesh Singh:** Part of the charter is aligning EPUB Accessiblity with the EUAA  

> *Avneesh Singh:* EU accessibility act requirements: [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj?eliuri=eli:dir:2019:882:oj](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj?eliuri=eli:dir:2019:882:oj)

**Luc Audrain:** We know the principles of EPUB Accessibility is WCAG  
… we know all this  
… in the EUAA, we find the same principles and requirements  
… POUR  
… these are spread inside the act in different concerns for products and services  
… product is devices (ATMs, websites), and the services are files, like EPUBs  
… services could be ticketing, ecommerce, etc  
… the provision of ebooks for reading is providing a service  
… services is where POUR comes in  
… the wordings are different between EPUB Accessibility and EUAA  
… how do we synchronize them  
… do we need to make them align in their wording?  

**Avneesh Singh:** There is a difference here  
… the EUAA has functional requirements  
… EPUB Accessibility has success criteria  
… EPUB Accessibility has more specific guidelines  
… for example, EUAA says there should be alternatives for text content, based on WCAG  
…   instead of adjusting  the success criteria, we should work on mapping of EU requirements with success criteria of EPUB Accessibility.


**Luc Audrain:** Section 3 of EUAA (see link)  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** This is what is existing in the directive  
… it's very high-level  
… as it also covers websites and other services  
… is WCAG is more based on success criteria or functional requirements  
… for the directive, they adopted based on WCAG  
… when you are talking about EPUB Accessibility, it also refers to WCAG  

**Avneesh Singh:** Yes, it refers to WCAG  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** This is very high-level  
… I think that mapping the high-level requirements to success criteria in EPUB Accessibility is a good idea  

**Luc Audrain:** That's how we need to make it  
… the discussions we had with Inmaculada (EU), for EPUB the requirements of the EUAA are covered  
… in EPUB Accessibility  

**Avneesh Singh:** What is the format of this? Do we want to provide mapping?  
… what is the structure and timeline  

**Luc Audrain:** The format should be a document with a mapping  
… where EUAA and EPUB Accessibility meet  
… the timing would be good to see in Q1 2021  
… January  
… she has to plan for the method in mid-2021  
… June  
… in June she would have to say "There's something for ebooks", and could point to EPUB  
… and it has been developed openly through consensus  
… she could direct the commission to this  
… otherwise she would have to direct an EU standardization body to develop one of their own  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** I don't think they would choose a format  
… they would choose any format that meets the requirements  
… we need to not only consider EPUB  
… the commission will not only recommend EPUB  
… it would be impossible for the commission to select only one  

**Avneesh Singh:** As far as success criteria, EPUB Accessibility is format independent to good extent 

**George Kerscher:** Do we need to change the title of the document in revision?  

**Avneesh Singh:** That is a broader discussion  

**George Kerscher:** It's a possibility though?  

**Avneesh Singh:** There's ways of doing it  
… we start with EPUB Accessibility and change the name  

**George Kerscher:** Something like digital publication conformance and discoverability  
… we need an introductory statement of how this document meets the requirements of the EUAA  
… link to the places in our specification that meets the functional requirements  
… walk through the document with links and affirmative statements  

**Luc Audrain:** I don't think we should change the name  
… it's for EPUB  
… and this will avoid the question of PDF  
… the commission will need technical specifications for ebooks in general  
… we haven't thoroughly discussed this with Inmaculada  
… if we say it is for digital publications, would it cover PDF?  

**Avneesh Singh:** The discussion we had in the past, the takeaway was if the EU is going for a harmonized standard, it needs to work with different technologies  
… if they want a technical standard, then any non-profit org can submit a specification  
… there can be more than one that meets the functional requirements. We can submit technical specifications for EPUB accessibility, PDF association may like to submit theirs..  

**Luc Audrain:** It's not for us to explain how PDF meets the requirements  
… what we would try to prove is that EPUB conforms  

**George Kerscher:** I agree, and if we don't have to change the name that's fine  
… when we think of the services  
… the provision of books by a publisher, once it's delivered to Amazon and changed, would the specification still be applied  
… everyone who ingests changes the book in some way  
… it doesn't honour the original  

**Avneesh Singh:** EU provides the functional requirements, Amazon has to meet them  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** The requirements are laid out, we need to provide the details, but it won't be format-specific  
… if there's a new format that is accessible and compliant in the future, they can't go back and change things, it needs to be future proof  

**Luc Audrain:** If in the case that the commission uses the technical specifications, any format on the market needs to prove conformance  
… it would be Amazon's job to prove that the kindle format is conformant  
… anyone publishing to PDF would have to do the same  
… on our side, we have to so the job for EPUB  
… I don't know if the commission would ask us for PDF  

**Avneesh Singh:** Speaking from a technical perspective, if we make EPUB Accessibility purely abstract  like WCAG, it would be challenging in this timeline 
… we would have to move a lot to techniques  

**Luc Audrain:** I don't think that is mandatory  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** We might need to add other metadata  
… the requirement is to have metadata distributable in the chain  
… if we discuss schema we might also need ONIX  

**Avneesh Singh:** There is a provision for having metadata othre than schema.org  
… for this call we should focus on the high-level plan  
… do we need a clarification from the representative to make EPUB Accessibility an abstract specification  
… or can we focus on EPUB  

**Luc Audrain:** It might be a good time to discuss with Inmaculada  
… we have a new revision  
… we plan to provide the necessary documents  
… showing the conformance  
… there is a missing link here between the act and the technical specifications  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** I'm not sure we need to go to her  
… we have done many meetings  
… she will not tell us exactly what is needed  
… we should start working  
… then we will have an idea of the challenges  
… if we tell her to accept this, we can seem like we're forcing this  
… we should focus on the mapping  

**Avneesh Singh:** Timeline wise, we will be prepared to have a FPWD in February  
… a draft of what we expect to send could be sent in January  

**Luc Audrain:** This timing should work  

**Avneesh Singh:** Short term plan, working on this mapping document  
… it should show the direction by January  
… after which we'll get feedback and carry on based on the feedback  
… Cristina and Luc, you will be working on this?  
… I will help as well, but I want the Europeans to take the lead  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** Gregorio as well  
… I am wondering how to format this  
… perhaps a table  
… with the EUAA requirements in one column, the EPUb Accessibility mapping, and comments  

**Avneesh Singh:** That sounds good  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** We've done it before, but we need to see if we have a 1:1 mapping for the elements  
… it could be that there are empty spaces  

**Wendy Reid:** That would be a good visualization of any gaps  

**George Kerscher:** I think the important gaps are if there's a missing requirement for an EUAA requirement  
… have an intro from the EPUB Accessibility doc, then the table, make any issues clear in the comments  

**Luc Audrain:** I can start a first draft  
… we can work together to figure this out  
… we can divide the work  
… there's less than 15 requirements  

**Avneesh Singh:** Where would we like to collaborate?  
… wiki on GitHub  

**Luc Audrain:** I am ok with that  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** Then we can all access the document  

**Avneesh Singh:** The optimized way is markdown and pull requests, but that is too heavy way right now  

**George Kerscher:** Is it easy to format a table in the wiki?  

**Avneesh Singh:** It's just markdown  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** I've received from ISO the documents that EPUB Accessibility has been approved  
… its official?  

**Avneesh Singh:** We were expecting approval in November, so it might be the notification  

**George Kerscher:** Did that come in today?  

**Cristina Mussinelli:** I got it this morning  

**Avneesh Singh:** All of the EPUB specifications in ISO are available for free  
… so we have the action plan, I will create the wiki and we can start collaborating  
… anything else to discuss today?
