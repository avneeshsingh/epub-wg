**Dave Cramer:** Welcome everyone, today we'll be talking about internationalization  
… Ivan went through the i18n questionnaire  
… filed a number of issues he encountered while performing the review  
… some of the members of the WG replied  
… we should go through the issues and make some decisions  
… first one is #1499  

### 1. What should be the default value for the dir attribute 
{: #section1}

_See github issue [#1499](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1499), [#1491](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1491)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1499 w3c/epub-specs/1491 -->



_See github pull request [#1498](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1498)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1498 -->



**Dave Cramer:** Also going to talk about 1491 because they're related  
… there is also a PR addressing this (#1498)  
… most of the i18n issues we face are in HTML, SVG, CSS, where we rely on those specs  
… our area of influence is the package doc  
… the `dir` attribute  
… it doesn't have a default value  
… some guidance from i18n says we should have a default of `auto`  
… lets the system decide what to do, which depends on them, and can be overwritten by `rtl` or `ltr`  
… we have a PR open to address this  
… Matt has added this  
… is this a good idea and will it break anything  
… `ltr` = left to right  
… `rtl` = right to left  

**Brady Duga:** I think there is some history we want to keep with HTMLs LTR by default  
… for our case it makes sense to use `auto` because that's how things work now  
… the default is `auto`  
… HTML doesn't have a default, but the root is LTR, but it also has more complex inheritance  

**Dave Cramer:** I don't want to worry about the HTML situation  
… there are complexities  
… it seems to me that adding auto is risk free as a default  
… I can't imagine writing a test where something would happen  

**Brady Duga:** The scarier thing is the inherent directionality of the text winning over the `dir` attribute  

**Dave Cramer:** I wonder that too  
… went down a rabbit hole  
… stared into the abyss...  

**Brady Duga:** If there's an inherent directionality, it wins over `dir`, `dir` might mean nothing  

**Dave Cramer:** base paragraph direction over the bits of text within  
… atomic elements of the package file that have no instructions  
… instinct to have auto as a nice to have  
… doesn't change existing behaviour  
… the only person who needs to worry is the tester  
… I would propose we resolve to add the auto value  
… does anyone object  

> **Proposed resolution: Add the default value of `auto` to the `dir` attribute, resolved 1491 and 1499** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> ***Resolution #1: Add the default value of `auto` to the `dir` element, resolved 1491 and 1499***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Dave Cramer:** We got it! Moving on to 1494  

### 2. Relationship between dir and the content 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1494](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1494)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1494 -->



**Dave Cramer:** i18n self test says *what is in the ticket*  
… spec specifies that directionality in unicode takes precedence  
… over the `dir` attribute  
… Matt says if there's strong directionality in the text, that takes precedence  
… `dir` doesn't control everything  
… see [r12a's comments](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1494#issuecomment-772459326)  
… what Richard says there makes sense  
… we need to remove that line in the spec stating that unicode directionality takes precedence  
… it would conflict with the guidance from Richard  
… address the issue by having Matt removing that bit and clarifying the text  
… the relationship between the string and the dir attribute  
… any opposition?  

**Ben Schroeter:** The change being that `dir` wins?  

**Dave Cramer:** Removing the line that says strings can override `dir`  

**Brady Duga:** I don't think anyone knows what it means  
… `dir` sets the base direction  
… but it has nothing to do with unicode for instance  
… the unicode API does that  
… we're reaching  
… we should just say "this is what `dir` does"  

**Dave Cramer:** This is a lesson, if you get that deep into it, it's confusing  

> **Proposed resolution: Fix 1494 by removing the untrue statement about the relationship between `dir` and the underlying text** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> ***Resolution #2: Fix 1494 by removing the untrue statement about the relationship between `dir` and the underlying text***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

### 3. Additional 'refines' values? 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#1493](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1493)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1493 -->



**Dave Cramer:** We'll resolve by PR  
… 1493, `<span>` should provide data for the interpretation of text  
… we are stuck with the DC terms language  
… which we can't control  
… we've used "refines" before  
… there's a lot of examples from Japan regarding sorting and pronunciation of names  
… we can't make this change to EPUB  
… we have these mechanism  
… if there's an important use case comes up that doesn't fit with what we already have  
… we'll address it, but we shouldn't try to create something without that information  

**Brady Duga:** I agree with Matt  

**Dave Cramer:** Me too  
… anyone else?  
… I would propose we close the issue, there's nothing for us to do here  

> **Proposed resolution: Close 1493 as we cannot fix this issue** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> ***Resolution #3: Close 1493 as we cannot fix this issue***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

### 4. Assuming direction from language 
{: #section4}

_See github issue [#1490](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1490)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1490 -->



**Dave Cramer:** 1490, do not assume that direction can be assumed from language information  
… but then we have PR 1498  

_See github pull request [#1498](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1498)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1498 -->



**Brady Duga:** If we accept 1498, we don't care about this, according to the comments  

**Dave Cramer:** Not to mention the i18n folks who have commented  
… this one is kind of moot  

**Brady Duga:** Will not fix, obsolete  

> **Proposed resolution: close 1490 because mooted by PR 1498** *(Dave Cramer)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> ***Resolution #4: close 1490 because mooted by PR 1498***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

### 5. Extra explanations on the effects of the `dir` attribute 
{: #section5}

_See github issue [#1489](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1489)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1489 -->



**Dave Cramer:** 1489, it must be possible to indicate changes in bidirectional text for the user  
… we're talking mostly about DC terms here  
… there's no inline markup  
… there's unicode marker characters for this  
… should we add some explanation that you need to use the unicode characters to do it  
… I'm generally in favour of putting useful info into the spec  
… provides clues to us when we go back to this  

**Brady Duga:** I think that's the reason we added the comment about inherent directionality  
… if we start talking about unicode conformance it can get confusing  
… we could look at HTML and see what they say  

**Dave Cramer:** is it safe to have non-normative text?  

**Brady Duga:** The comment was a brief overview of a complicated issue  
… we could put a generic pointer  

**Dave Cramer:** We should probably avoid this as we don't understand it well  
… something obvious to us might be wrong, unlikely to be helpful  
… this is not our lane  

**Brady Duga:** Is there a lot of usage for this?  

**Dave Cramer:** I've so far been unable to change behaviour of a RS by changing the dir attribute  
… I would propose we close this, as we do meet the requirements  

> **Proposed resolution: Close 1489, we have met the i18n requirements** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> ***Resolution #5: Close 1489, we have met the i18n requirements***
{: #resolution5 .resolution}

**Dave Cramer:** Moving on...  

### 6. Missing `hreflang` attribute 
{: #section6}

_See github issue [#1488](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1488)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1488 -->



**Dave Cramer:** 1488  
… missing `hreflang` attribute  
… *see issue*  
… there is a PR from Matt  

_See github pull request [#1497](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1497)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1497 -->



**Dave Cramer:** PR 1497  
… this is designed for the links in the package file  
… if we're linking to external metadata, we can determine the language of the file  
… consistent with other vocabularies  
… this would be new, and wouldn't break anything  
… any comments?  

**Ben Schroeter:** Trying to understand the usage of this?  

**Dave Cramer:** Say you have a multi-lingual epub, multiple metadata records  
… norwegian canadian dictionary that has one record in norwegian and one in canadian english  
… if the UI is set in one language, it can know to present the correct metadata to the user  
… the RS doesn't have to determine the vocab from the resource, it can determine before download  
… a hint  

**Ben Schroeter:** Ok  

**Dave Cramer:** I'm not aware of a RS that does this  

**Brady Duga:** You can link to external metadata records? /sarcasm  

**Dave Cramer:** We can write a test for it, but no RS will test it  

**Ben Schroeter:** And where will you find a Norwegian-Canadian dictionary...  

**Brady Duga:** This PR does add another untestable conformance requirement  

**Dave Cramer:** I feel we're a little bit stuck here  
… it's an i18n best practice  
… if we say we're going to have linked metadata, we should have this  
… we put this in, we get tests, the concept gets marked as at-risk at CR  
… I think we should accept the PR, then see what testing shows us

{: .proposed_resolution}

> ***Resolution #6: Close 1488, accept PR 1497***
{: #resolution6 .resolution}

**Dave Cramer:** Progress!  
… on i18n issues at least  
… thanks everyone
