### 2. Remaining i18n issues 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1508](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1508), [#1509](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1509)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1508 w3c/epub-specs/1509 -->



**Wendy Reid:** 2 i18n issues remain after the review  

**Dave Cramer:** the two issues are pretty intertwined  
… i18n should require valid lang tags  
… there is a formal grammar which describes the formal structure of language tags  
… so, well-formedness  

> *Leonard Rosenthol:* I believe that lang is ISO 3166

**Matt Garrish:** we enforce well formed, but nothing about validity  

**Dave Cramer:** a valid tag is one which matches the actual languages  
… so should we require lang tags to be valid?  
… and what should RS do when faced with invalid lang tag?  
… not want to make requirement more stringent  
… hard to check validity of lang tags  
… its a list of strings that changes over time  
… burden on epubcheck  
… also, there could be existing epub with well formed but invalid lang tags - a change could cause those epubs to fail epubcheck  
… should having a valid lang tag just be a best practice?  
… so epubcheck would just flag it as an informative warning  

> *Wendy Reid:* leonardr:

**Leonard Rosenthol:** [here's the info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang  
… BCP-47 is the technical spec, you can validate against that if you want  
… but i think we should do what HTML does, no more, no ness  

**Matt Garrish:** some of this came up in epubcheck itself, when someone complained that there was no check for lang validity  
… also, the epubcheck folks seemed to say that it would be a hard thing to implement  
… and unless there is some critical function, a RS is going to ignore this  
… and there are currently no critical functions that rely on this very general metadata  
… nothing bad comes of this lang tag not being specified properly  
… in pub manifest we said that well-formedness is good enough  

**Wendy Reid:** also, we'd run into issues with testing this if we wanted to make this stricter  

**Dave Cramer:** matt has more or less convinced me that this isn't broken  

> *Brady Duga:* +1 to not broken

**Dave Cramer:** ... the costs of fixing it are higher than the purely theoretical benefits of conforming to broadly worded i18n guidelines

**Dave Cramer:** i propose that we close this without fixing  

**Matt Garrish:** something like WCAG could have stricter rules about lang tags, but for us its not a critical piece of metadata  

**Ben Schroeter:** i like the idea of doing some sort of warning in epubcheck  
… also, i don't want to tell RS what to do in general  
… RS want to be as lax as possible when it comes to what they will ingest  
… they don't want to keep content authors off their RS

> ***Resolution #2: Close issue 1509 with no action***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Dave Cramer:** for 1508 (i.e. question of what RS should do with poorly-formed lang tag)  

**Dave Cramer:** there was a suggestion that the RS treat the lang as "und" (i.e. undefined)  
… that to me is a satisfactory solution to this somewhat theoretical problem  

> *Leonard Rosenthol:* +1

> **Proposed resolution: Close issue 1508, add text to RS specification instructing reading systems to treat a poorly-formed language tag as "und" (undefined)** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Brady Duga:** is this yet another untestable assertion?  
… should we tell RS what to do with this at all?  

**Matt Garrish:** i suggested the "und" thing because i thought we'd done this in pub manifest as well  
… but i think we actually went back and decided to remain silent on it  
… "we're not going to define what it means for the RS"  

**Dave Cramer:** testing it would require reading the minds of the RS  
… what we're actually using the lang tag for is trying to guess at page progression direction?  
… how would we know if the RS is actually doing this?  
… so maybe another "close, won't fix"?  

**Ben Schroeter:** if we feel the RS wants some sort of guidance we could change the proposal to say "suggest"  
… but i'm also happy to drop it  

**Matt Garrish:** i think there's something worrisome about RS determining lang for the author  
… i'd rather RS do nothing  

**Dave Cramer:** would also add that RS don't seem to be looking for guidance

### 3. Origin, cont'd 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#873](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/873), [#1156](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1156)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/873 w3c/epub-specs/1156 -->



**Wendy Reid:** this is continuing from last week's meeting  

**Dave Cramer:** i think most of the discussion is in issue 1153  
… we've struggled with how to specify scripting in epub  
… we've gotten lots of questions from outside the group about how our security model ties in with the security model of the rest of the web  
… we have non-normative text in the spec  
… leonard has mentioned the concept of security boundaries, with origin being main boundary in Web world  
… my opinion is that the text we currently have is wrong  
… boundary should be around the epub and not the content document  
… e.g. where content documents within an epub want to share a resource  
… also, origin is more the concept we're going for, not domain (which is what we currently reference)  
… could we say that each epub should be an opaque/unique origin  
… even if not particularly testable, at least it is a stake in the ground  
… re. how we are trying to fit into the web security model  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** the thing that is most problematic is the difference between actually doing this in a browser with a content hosted on a real domain vs doing this on a device (mobile, desktop, etc.)  
… in the device scenario the RS can completely control the origin  
… the RS sets up the origin  
… so your statements about every epub being its own RS can be done on device, but you can't do that on the web  
… so controlling scripts within the context of an origin makes sense in the device scenario, but not in the web scenario  
… that's the main issue  

**Dave Cramer:** i hear you  
… in the RS i'm aware of that are web-based, there is a pretty big disconnect between what you see in the URL bar and what is actually happening inside the RS  
… is it reasonable to ask the RS to follow a stricter set of rules than would be required by the generic web security model  
… say Hachette decided to put all their books on a domain, I think its reasonable to say that if an RS were to do that they need to architect it so that all books aren't on the same origin as each other  
… i see this as adding requirements to implementation if the implementation happens to be web-based  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** the problem is that you can't do that  
… we tried to do that with sub-origins, but that hasn't been touched since 2017  
… never implemented seriously  
… never made it through the webapp sec WG  
… in your example, all your epubs are originated off the same thing, they would all share the same local storage etc.  
… if those are all your books, that's fine, but once that content goes outside, there's no guarantee that books from different publishers won't be able to see each other  

**Dave Cramer:** could you solve that problem with different subdomains for each title?  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** yes, but only in a world where all the epubs come from the same publisher  
… e.g. an epub from patreaon uploaded to dropbox or onedrive  
… that book would have access to all of dropbox  

**Dave Cramer:** you're kind of creating a non-conforming RS in this example  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** that would make all web-based RS non-conforming  

**Wendy Reid:** I think dropbox actually does have an ebook reader....  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** they're probably taking advantage of no scripting then  

**Wendy Reid:** i think the solution that most RS have come to is just to avoid scripting entirely  
… easiest way out of the origin problem  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** that doesn't solve other things, e.g. referencing  
… trying to reference a font or other resource inside that domain as a relative link  
… nothing prevents referencing outside the epub at that point (e.g. ../../)  
… and assuming this is served via HTTPS, that gives it a lot more privileges than an non-secure URL  

**Brady Duga:** this really seems like a scripting issue  
… you have to make sure you don't access things you don't own  
… but that isn't an origin issue, that a rights access issue  
… the real problem is storing cookies, and then someone else's book accessing it  

**Dave Cramer:** Jiminy has real world examples of this sort of stuff  
… e.g. an epub in ibooks that goes and finds info about other books  
… is there anything in the spec right now that says that's bad?  

**Brady Duga:** maybe? It depends on the RS and the content  
… e.g. RS for a school, where every student shares every book, that would be okay  
… one book might want to check how far a student got in another book  
… i.e. not a bad idea in ALL cases  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** if, say, you're building your own software and documents, and you control the entire system there's no reason why you wouldn't want to do it that way  

**Dave Cramer:** one thing to do is go back to our current language  
… do we still want to say that every content document in the same epub should belong to a different domain?  

**Leonard Rosenthol:** can probably change that so that each epub is its own origin, like you said earlier  

**Matt Garrish:** the original wording came at a time when we were just starting to open epub to scripting  
… we were designing it to be as restrictive as possible  
… we've tried to dodge this in the past by limiting where scripting is allowed  

**Dave Cramer:** to me i feels like a little bit of progress if we relax the current language to say "per epub" instead of "per content document"  
… this leaves us vulnerable to intra-epub security issues  
… but that really seems like more of an authoring problem than a problem with the spec  

**Brady Duga:** right now the spec is more restrictive, but we're already finding examples IRL where RS are not honoring it  
… from testing perspective, its not clear how this would be implemented  

**Matt Garrish:** depends where we are going with this  
… right now that section is only informative, so that's fine  
… if we change the section to be normative, then yes, that might be an issue  

**Dave Cramer:** given all that, should we take the baby step of updating the non-normative guidance that the boundary should be "per epub"?  
… consensus on this?  

> *Leonard Rosenthol:* +1

> *Matt Garrish:* +1

**Brady Duga:** does that include changing from "domain" to "origin"?  

**Dave Cramer:** yes, i think so  
… stuff about port randomization scares me a little bit as someone who wants to do something useful with scripting

{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**Wendy Reid:** that's everything that was on the agenda tonight  

**Dave Cramer:** i think i do have an action item to talk to TAG about the general ideas around epub security  

**Wendy Reid:** there is most likely going to be a special session at the business group next week about WCAG3  
… silver is going to be presenting to business group about WCAG3  
… extending the invitation here  
… i will send out meeting details on the mailing list  
… WCAG3 calls out epub as a standard several times  
… probably worth providing our feedback  
… meeting date is Tues 233d, noon Boston time  
… AOB?  
… no? Thank you everyone, and thank you leonardr!
