### 1. Reporting accessibility conformance 
{: #section1}

_See github issue [#1455](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1455)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1455 -->



**Avneesh Singh:** mgarrish if you could please provide an overview?  

**Matt Garrish:** basically, what should we do with the IDPF urls we have now, specific to WCAG2?  
… given the flexibility that we have around which version and level of WCAG, i don't know that we can do a URL approach to this  
… we can either come up with a new pattern of URL where you can plug-in the values of your version and level  
… or we do a text field following a strict pattern  
… it might ultimately come down to whether ONIX requires a URL, or if they can take text strings  

**Avneesh Singh:** it looks obvious that having a single URL `conformsto` value is the way to go  
… or, we could have a text string that has epub a11y version, wcag version, and level  

**Matt Garrish:** the problem is that we allow so many variations in 1.1  
… any url that represents would involve a bunch of parameters  
… a patterned text string would be easier for humans to work with  

**Charles LaPierre:** first, we want to make sure that whatever we do is backwards compatibility with the current version  
… for the old epubs  
… second, for the future, the silver TF just presented a future version of WCAG that replaces the A, AA level with bronze, silver, gold  
… and rn vitalsource is looking for a particular string, because publishers are putting in their own custom `conformsto` values  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** from ONIX point of view, they said that they are okay with adding new values  
… but it is uncommon in ONIX to just take text as a value  
… if we do ask them to ask code values, they said that they only update twice a year  
… so there may be a delay in updating  

**Avneesh Singh:** there was also a comment that a url could be provided in ONIX?  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** normally in ONIX there is a closed dictionary of values that can be assigned - i.e. a codelist  
… you could make it a free text value, which could take a URL  
… but if you are using an automatic solution for parsing ONIX, this could be complicated by free text  
… for example, in ONIX, you can use URLs to point to supplemental resources  
… but not usually as data references  
… so are we talking about using a single URL, with various parameters?  

**Avneesh Singh:** yes  
… there is also the question of customized accessibility spec, e.g. an optimized publication  
… these would also require a customized url  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** using a text field to store a URL also presents issues with being able to validate  

**Matt Garrish:** i'm not sure we can make our solution compatibility with 1.0  
… because the URLs would have to be to W3C pages instead of the old IDPF  
… if we are concerned that people are already setup to look for URLs, that could be a consideration to continue using a URL based system instead of going with a text string  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** so to summarize, we have 3 pieces of data, a11y version, wcag version, and level? So maybe we can have 3 ONIX fields to track this...  

**Tzviya Siegman:** i understand that vitalsource is already setup to use urls, but especially as WCAG advances, this is going to get more and more complicated  
… 3.0 is coming, and we don't know which version of WCAG people are going to be using  
… the number of URLs that we'd have to keep track of might not be that manageable  
… a text string may be easier to maintain  

**Avneesh Singh:** to clarify, the URL could be reference to a11y spec, and then WCAG could be identified separately  

**Matt Garrish:** also, these `conformsto` values are for machines to process, not necessarily for humans to read. Don't forget that people can also put information about a11y in accessibility summary  

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* it's like namespace in XML, you always get 404 :)

**Charles LaPierre:** point about validation, if a particular URL references a page that doesn't exist, that could be flagged by an automatic validator, right?  

**Matt Garrish:** the URLs would be de-referenced, they would just be for machines to parse to extract a11y metadata  

**George Kerscher:** does this meet the publisher's desire to put their own `conformsto` string in their publications? Is this repeatable?  
… makoto also mentioned in issue tracker that he needs flexibility to add different properties in there  

**Matt Garrish:** there's no limitation to the number of `conformsto`  

> **Proposed resolution: Single URL for conformance, EPUB accessibility specs string + WCAG version and level** *(Avneesh Singh)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* +1 to Charles

**Charles LaPierre:** since you can have multiple `conformsto`, why not have the 3 as separate `conformsto` statements?  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** i like this, for me it is more readable  
… also, this allows us to expose real URLs to end users, which will lead to read documents  

**Matt Garrish:** i'm not sure that would work, because there is no real webpage for each level of conformance  
… no level A page, level AA page, etc.  

**Tzviya Siegman:** and its not always so easy to say "i conform to AA"  
… a lot of books partially conform to AA, missing one thing  
… that sort of data sometimes is not so black and white  

**Charles LaPierre:** mgarrish, would we put a refines on the `conformsto` WCAG version?  

**Matt Garrish:** right... but then we'd have to come up with a new property, with a new set of values  

**Tzviya Siegman:** refines is going away eventually  

**Matt Garrish:** to me, even two pieces seems complicated to ask people to put in their publications  

**Charles LaPierre:** even with vitalsource, who are parsing this, they are seeing maybe 5 different conformsto in some books  
… and they don't know which one to look at for wcag version, which for wcag level, etc.  

**George Kerscher:** does the proposed approach work with ONIX, assuming that we can add new codes?  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** not sure, I can check with Graham  
… they would prefer to have 3 fields in ONIX, but that doesn't necessarily change our spec, we can still have one single URL in our publications  

**Ben Schroeter:** we need to think about how `conformsto` will actually be used  
… e.g. if we actually expect people to go to that URL, or just a way to designate a11y metadata  
… are we making it too hard, on ourselves, on publishers, by being so particular about the level?  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* I could imagine a publisher saying `@conformsto="VPAT"`

**Ben Schroeter:** when they could just put that info, if they want, into the accessibility summary?  

**Avneesh Singh:** confromsto is for distributors and retailers  
… and different states will have different a11y legislation that require conformance data  

**Ben Schroeter:** and we have to give consideration to alternative specifications  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** i think that from an end user point of view, knowing that a publication conforms to A vs AA makes a difference  
… conformsto works towards retailers being able to filter publications by this level  

**Matt Garrish:** so, these things are identifiers, they're not meant to be surfaced to users necessarily  
… a machine is going to parse it before an end user ever sees it  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1 to Matt

**Matt Garrish:** our solution should be useful to machines - and either URL or formatted text string meets this criteria  

> *Charles LaPierre:* +1 as well to Matt

**Avneesh Singh:** if we are recommended the triple of data in a single URL, that doesn't prevent anyone from putting a different URL to their own spec, etc.  
… we are just saying that if you are using EPUB a11y, then please use this URL, if not, they are free to use some other value  

**George Kerscher:** can you explain "3 strings in a URL"?  

**Avneesh Singh:** let's say "single field, with 3 strings" then  

> **Proposed resolution: single field with three strings EPUB acessibility + WCAG version + level** *(Avneesh Singh)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *George Kerscher:* +1

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* 0

**Avneesh Singh:** gpellegrino to please update ONIX people  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** yes, okay  

> *Ben Schroeter:* 0

> *Matt Garrish:* So: EPUB Accessibility 1.1 + WCAG 2.0 Level AA?

**Bill Kasdorf:** are we going to be providing specific vocabulary for those three things?  

**Avneesh Singh:** yes  

**Charles LaPierre:** I thought we started off with the URL approach... i'm not as confident with the single text string, with 3 parts  
… then we have to explain which delimiters to use between the three parts  
… with a URL and parameters, this is already done for us, there's only the one way to do it  

**Avneesh Singh:** is this a serious problem, do you think?  

**Charles LaPierre:** ...not sure  

**Matt Garrish:** we could also enumerate the 6 currently possible strings, with instructions about how to increment the WCAG number  
… so its not necessarily that problematic  

**Charles LaPierre:** the idea of providing some pre-formatted examples is a good direction  
… with some precautions put in place for future proofing against WCAG 3  

**Matt Garrish:** right, and we can put language in there about replacing A and AA with bronze, silver, etc.  

> *Charles LaPierre:* +1

**Avneesh Singh:** CharlesL, please solicit feedback from distributors/retailers currently parsing `conformsto`  

**Charles LaPierre:** okay

### 2. Explainer for difference between audio books, Media Overlays, and read aloud 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1514](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1514)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1514 -->



**Avneesh Singh:** last meeting we said we wanted to clarify this somewhere, and we were going to leave this to mgarrish  

**Matt Garrish:** i looked at it, and wasn't sure how this fits in  
… if this is just a general primer, i suggest an informative note  
… maybe something for the CG to come up with that could be referenced in various specs  
… otherwise, we should clarify the purpose behind this, and then include a more narrow discussion in the immediately relevant portion of the spec (e.g. maybe MO)  

**George Kerscher:** i see confusion about this from higher learning people all the time  
… i think we should hand this off to CG to write an explainer  
… its useful for training people, but it might not belong in a spec  

**Avneesh Singh:** and we could link to the explainer from the spec  

**Tzviya Siegman:** if the goal is to ask the documentation group in CG to work on this, they are pretty busy right now, it could take a while  
… i think this could be a very short document  

**Matt Garrish:** i just don't know that this is a WG note, we could still handle this when we're doing CG work  

**Avneesh Singh:** this isn't really related to specs, this is more a publishing issue  

**Tzviya Siegman:** Laura Brady had mentioned that public funding might be put towards writing a11y documentation  
… this might fall into that category

### 3. AOB
{: #section3}

**Avneesh Singh:** the rest of our agenda concerns pagelist, page numbering... not sure if we can cover this in the remaining time  

**Matt Garrish:** no, we probably won't be able to  

**George Kerscher:** i think we should be attacking this problem on a holistic level  
… such that when we close all these related pagelist issues, we close them all with the same solution  
… also, should should I raise an issue about virtual page numbers?  
… EBSCO is looking at possibility of adding virtual page numbers to any publication they ingest which does not have them  

**Avneesh Singh:** i think so  
… we might not be able to resolve it, but there is no harm in documenting the issue  
… thank you everyone!
