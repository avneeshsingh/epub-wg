**Wendy Reid:** this week we are going through outstanding issues  
… a lot of them are carryover issues from prior versions of spec  

### 1. Media type parameter for EPUB 
{: #section1}

_See github issue [#1026](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1026)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1026 -->



**Wendy Reid:** epub type parameter would add hint to epub mime type about the specific epub  
… e.g. is it FXL? Does it have a special DRM?  
… these hints can be interpreted by RS for specific functionality  
… there was a concern about backwards compatibility, but it was determined that that wasn't really an issue  
… however, a lot of this same info can be found in package metadata  

**Brady Duga:** clarify that this is changing IANA registration, not the mimetype file  

**Wendy Reid:** benjamin posted that there is an existing registry of IANA properties  

> *Matthew Chan:* dauwhe joining by call-in

**Dave Cramer:** without interest from multiple implementers I'm not sure that we should invest in this issue speculatively

### 2. Allow multiple instances of `dcterms:modified` 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#841](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/841)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/841 -->



**Wendy Reid:** I believe the initial intent was to allow this to show progression of update to book  

**Matt Garrish:** yeah, a revision history  
… at the time we cared because of Release Identifier  
… but now it doesn't seem to matter as much  
… but if we have multiple, we should define which one is the last modified  

**Brady Duga:** I also don't really care, but what does this enable?  
… you can't add comments to these fields, so it would just be a bunch of ambiguous dates and times  
… not against removing restriction on only having one, but also not really any features that would benefit from doing so  

**Wendy Reid:** in practice, one thing that I've seen publishers do is track the version of the epub on the copyright page  

**Dave Cramer:** all the big trade publishers do that  
… ours is a long string that is unintelligible to outsiders  
… and we'd keep doing this regardless of changes to this field

**Wendy Reid:** mgarrish please feel free to refine the language  

> ***Resolution #2: Close issue 841, will not change usage of dcterms:modified***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

### 3. Complex page layouts 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#588](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/588)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/588 -->



**Wendy Reid:** basically asking why nothing exists between reflow and completely fixed layouts  
… e.g. something like fixed, but which could respond to things like media queries  
… now we have things like grid and flexbox  

**Matt Garrish:** we could really get sucked into something big like this  
… it really needs to be fleshed out  
… and could have a seriously negative impact on readability of some epubs  

**Brady Duga:** this also comes from a time when people were trying to do a lot with magazines in epub format  
… not so much of a priority these days  
… may be another feature with lack of implementation support  

**Dave Cramer:** i think its hard to do things without proposed implementations (i.e. how it would work in detail, what it would enable)  
… probably not for our current spec  

**Wendy Reid:** I see the use case, but agree with mgarrish that there could be a big negative impact on a11y if done badly  
… more experimentation is needed first  

**Dave Cramer:** ultimately something other than fxl could help a11y, but we don't know what that is  

**Wendy Reid:** has anyone done any interesting experiments in this area in JP?  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** in japan, it is not easy to make fxls  
… fxl content and magazines are mostly made using images

### 4. [Media Overlays] Add `media:paused`-class 
{: #section4}

_See github issue [#428](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/428)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/428 -->



**Brady Duga:** this was a way to style content when MO playback is paused  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** so, you'd be playing MO and an element would be highlighted, and then you would pause, and the style of that element would change to whatever is defined by media:paused  

**Wendy Reid:** e.g. the highlight could change to an underline  

**Brady Duga:** so right now, when you pause, what happens when you pause?  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** we don't say what should happen  

**Brady Duga:** so this would make behaviour clearer  

**Wendy Reid:** this is something that RSes might already have found a behaviour for...  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** I think different RSes do their own thing  
… from an implementation point of view, if you don't address this, then the styling will just stay even when the MO playback is paused  
… could this open up a can of worms?  

**Wendy Reid:** most RSes that implement MO also implement a standard style  
… that overwrites what the content says  

**Brady Duga:** we don't do that, we just go with whatever style the content says to apply for MO playback  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** i'm trying to think of what impact this has on synched media where we do highlighting in a pretty different way  

**Wendy Reid:** could we just defer this to synched media?  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** synced media already has a pretty long list of deferred things  

**Brady Duga:** one thing to consider is that if we do add this, existing content would be absolutely okay  
… and then if new content begins to use this feature, it's fairly easy to implement  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** a player can also do this without it formally being in spec, but its just that author wouldn't be able to pick the style  

**Dave Cramer:** who filed the original issue?  

> *Matthew Chan:* all now referring to posts in the issue

**Dave Cramer:** i think we should ask around to see if people are actually interested in using this feature

### 5. Handling of `dc:title` 
{: #section5}

_See github issue [#1527](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1527), [#1553](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1553)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1527 w3c/epub-specs/1553 -->



**Wendy Reid:** these next two are related  
… there was some confusion about the example provided for `<dc:title>`  
… specifically when there are multiple, but they have different `xml:lang`-s  
… the discussion raised the question of whether refines needs a translation value  
… because the different titles might not be translations of one another  

**Dave Cramer:** is there any RS that does anything with the title beyond the bare minimum?  

**Wendy Reid:** probably no  

**Dave Cramer:** i've been writing tests and most RS seem to just display the first of each when there are fields that can occur multiple times  
… authors are asking for more expressive power, but no RS seems to be presenting this additional data to the user  

**Matt Garrish:** we tried what Laurent brought up in the issue  
… up to epub 3.1 you had to define your title type  
… and nobody used it, so we took it out  
… we'd be going back in circles. I think maybe we should just move on.  
… about the refines translation, we haven't found a case for it  
… people aren't making one epub with metadata in all these different various languages  

**Brady Duga:** agreed to all of that  
… unclear what an RS should even do when presented with the title in multiple different languages  

**Wendy Reid:** especially if the book itself is only in one language  
… one of the concerns we had was about JP, because Japanese has 3 different script sets, for lack of a better way of explaining it  
… so could an RS potentially implement a feature where the user could swap between script sets?  

**Dave Cramer:** ultimately the purpose of title is so you can distinguish books within your own collection  
… not meant to be as rigorous as a metadata record at some high level aggregator level (e.g. library of congress)  
… maybe change not needed  

**Brady Duga:** should we clarify the example then?  

**Matt Garrish:** we can't get rid of multipart `dc:titles` at this point  
… so do we guide people towards putting everything in a single title?  

**Dave Cramer:** I think our examples should reflect what will work for most people  
… so maybe we need to dial back the example  

**Matt Garrish:** or say that you can do multipart titles, but that there is no guarantee that RS can use them, or guarantee as to consistency  

**Brady Duga:** say "you can put multipart titles, but nobody knows what will happen, so you should probably only put one"  

> **Proposed resolution: Close issues 1527 and 1553, add editorial note regarding the current use of `dc:title` in the market** *(Wendy Reid)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Wendy Reid:** this should probably be an editorial note

### 6. Reporting accessibility conformance 
{: #section6}

_See github issue [#1455](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1455)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1455 -->



**Wendy Reid:** there was a comment about whether the resolved solution raises i18n issues  

**Matt Garrish:** we'll wait to see what the i18n folks say about it  

**Wendy Reid:** ivan mentioned that not all languages use spaces, so our patterned string, which does, might be problematic  

**Matt Garrish:** hopefully people are just copying and pasting this, instead of trying to type it in  

**Wendy Reid:** if people are using production tools, this is just going to be inserted programmatically  
… but we need answers from i18n before we can resolve this question  

### 7. AOB?
{: #section7}

**Wendy Reid:** have a lovely evening/friday. We'll see you all next week!
