**Avneesh Singh:** let's move to the first issue originally created by gpellegrino and elevated by mgarrish  

### 1. Page list ordering 
{: #section1}

_See github issue [#1500](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1500)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1500 -->



**Matt Garrish:** right now the pagelist is required to follow spine+content order  
… pagelist will therefore match digital sequencing  
… but should we lift the requirement, therefore allowing the pagelist to follow print sequencing  
… right now there is no choice in it  
… we did require this for toc, and we reduced that requirement  
… i don't have a strong position on this  
… it really comes down to which one users expect, and what makes sense  

**Avneesh Singh:** thoughts?  

**Wendy Reid:** i have no seen RS that uses pagelist to dictate page number order in epub  
… kobo doesn't do it  
… pagelist is more likely treated as just an additional nav aid, like toc  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** as far as i've tested i think that apple books uses it for UI toc, where they put "real" page numbers for different toc entries  
… from my point of view, which are the use cases for end users for the pagelist?  
… what are the requirements for RS?  
… what are the requirements for content producers?  

**Avneesh Singh:** one use case i would like to mention is if there is a classroom, and there are students using print, and a blind student using ebook  
… if teacher says "move to page X", then it make sense for pagelist to match print  

**Bill Kasdorf:** what is the relationship of the pagebreak markers to the pagelist?  
… i thought they always had to correspond?  

**Matt Garrish:** They have to correspond. So, they need to be included in the pagelist, but why should they match the order of the epub content?  

> *Bill Kasdorf:* +1 to Matt

**Matt Garrish:** e.g. if an epub has reordered pages, and you're looking for a particular print correspondence page, then how do you find it (without using a UI where you can type in a page number)  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** another use case could be for quotations, and for finding quotations in books  
… usually quotations are based on print page numbers  
… also, from UI point of view, few RS are using something like an input tool to navigate to page  
… because there can be a mix of page number styles (e.g. a, i, I, arabic numbers)  
… hard for a single tool to find any given page  

**Wendy Reid:** any time i've seen implementation of pagelist it has been in toc style (e.g. a list of links)  
… in this case it makes more sense to follow the correspondence order (e.g. print)  
… and always be in linear sequence, of course  

**Avneesh Singh:** so it seems like we are all in favour of relaxing the requirement of pagelist following content order  

**Matt Garrish:** i think we can have some sort of a recommendation, at least, that pagelist follow the print  

**Bill Kasdorf:** i've always thought of pagelist as a correspondence tool to an authoritative print equivalent  
… but for publications without print equivalent, what is the purpose of pagelist?  

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* CFI?

**Wendy Reid:** this is virtual page numbers. We're exploring this topic. The need for these has become more prevalent recently  

**Bill Kasdorf:** this is a key distinction. We should be careful with the distinction  
… only use page number for print equivalent. The other one should be called "locators"  

**Avneesh Singh:** we are using the same terms in wcag 2.2

**Avneesh Singh:** this may require main group approval later  

**Wendy Reid:** we're going to have to discuss this in the main group call, maybe on the agenda next week  

**Avneesh Singh:** mgarrish will make changes and do PR  

### 2. Rechecking accessibility 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1470](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1470)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1470 -->



**Matt Garrish:** this came up in ISO. How long does the certification of content being accessible last for? e.g. For website the certification might degrade over 5 years, after which the accessibility certification might not be trustworthy anymore  
… less of a concern for packaged up epubs that shouldn't change  
… but what about reissues of epubs?  
… should we have guidance for that? A specific recommendation? Leave it to authors?  

**Avneesh Singh:** it will depend on publisher processes  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** we check all the books published by our members  
… we hash each epub  
… so when we get a new file that matches an existing isbn, we match the hashes  
… if hash mismatch, we recheck a11y  

**Charles LaPierre:** for GCA, once we certify a publisher, they can stamp all books coming off that workflow as certified  
… but the publisher must get recertified each year  
… and that recertification process will bring them up to the state of the art  
… if they then reissue epub after that point, then they can update the certification as well  
… i.e. our solution is to keep the publisher up to date  

**Avneesh Singh:** if the user gets an old ebook, say 3 years old, how can the user ensure that the latest revision is accessible?  

**Charles LaPierre:** the user would just refer to the a11y metadata in the reprint. And it would be up to the publisher to use the latest standards in the publishing pipeline  
… between recertifications, we leave this up to the publisher  

**Ben Schroeter:** if its a new edition, i would consider that a new publication  
… that would go through whatever processes the publisher uses for normal a11y check  
… in terms of GCA certified publishers  
… i can see a case where a title goes through the certified workflow, but on republication changes are made (e.g. inserted image) that doesn't conform with a11y standards  
… this is a potential gap  
… and also, we may be moving towards a world in which there are more and more frequent updates to epubs  

**Wendy Reid:** any guidelines we put in place will have to apply across the board - from GCA certified to micro indie publisher  
… for a lot of repubs, the content of the book is not really changing (maybe just update to copyright page or something)  
… so we have to be careful of mandating recheck on "new hash" or every new revision  
… maybe qualify by saying "if adding new content" or "if substantially changing content"  

> *Charles LaPierre:* +1 Wendy

**Wendy Reid:** but have exclusion for if you are just fixing typos or updating marketing material  
… also, re. comparison between epub and website, epubs don't replicate at the same rate  

**Matt Garrish:** i think it has to be an informative section  
… what wendyreid has described is similar to the qualifications that we once had on release identifier  
… this is probably as far as we can go  
… don't want to get mired in questions of what it means to recheck  
… maybe just say that standards change, and that when you do something to your epub you should just make sure that you are on top of the latest standards  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** one of our ideas was to add date of certification  
… e.g. in accessibility summary  

**Charles LaPierre:** the idea of a certification date is something we could definitely add  
… that way publishers could change the certification date, or not, when they make other changes to the epub  
… i'm wondering about if the publisher modifies something 3 years from now, and URLs for conformsTo have changed  
… do they change the URLs to new URLs, or leave them as what they were at the point of initial certification?  

**Matt Garrish:** hard question to answer, because we're not negating the old standards  
… maybe the date based system is a good way to go  
… hard to make normative statements because of all the possibilities  
… maybe we could rely on legislation to set the rules, and just offer some guidance  

**Avneesh Singh:** we can start by providing non-normative text like mgarrish suggested  
… let this mature for some number of years, and then revisit it  

**George Kerscher:** when a publisher is doing update or new edition, if they have switched to a11y 1.1, wouldn't they just start using the correct metadata URLs at that point?  
… publishers are not all going to go from a11y 1.0 to 1.1 all at once

### 3. Audio hazards 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#1302](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1302)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1302 -->



**Avneesh Singh:** in the hazards there are parameters for visual hazards in WCAG (e.g. flashing no more than 3 per second)  
… but no equivalent for audio hazards  
… how are publishers to classify which audio will causes issues for users?  

**Matt Garrish:** i looked into this years back with Madeleine Rothberg  
… in the github tracker, one potential standard was indicated  
… but it is harder to classify these sorts of audio hazards than with visual hazards  
… maybe we just play it safe and recommend that if there is any sound at all then there might be a hazard  
… if the absence of a clear standard, what do we say?  

**George Kerscher:** sudden increases in volume were the problem, could potentially damage hearing  
… that's the sort of thing that should be flagged as an audio hazard  
… that sudden increase in sound that could damage hearing  

**Bill Kasdorf:** "any audio" seems broad  
… it would catch even the books with only narration  

**Charles LaPierre:** increase in decibel level is probably a good way to put it  
… and then also something about tones (like in those hearing tests)  

**Charles LaPierre:** probably some text around those is all we need  

**Ben Schroeter:** I think its kind of meaningless unless its quantifiable  

> *Matt Garrish:* +1 to ben

**Ben Schroeter:** anything else (e.g. warning there could be explosions) is not likely to be enforceable  

**Charles LaPierre:** i think some of that could be machine checked (e.g. with AI)  

**Avneesh Singh:** we can rely on research done by wcag on this  

> *Gregorio Pellegrino:* +1 to Avneesh, I would forward it to WCAG

**Wendy Reid:** we should probably ask for quantifiable information that we can provide to content producers  
… there is a body of research on the topic of hazardous sounds  
… and with the increasing popularity of audiobooks, i've seen increases in the creative use of sound  

**Avneesh Singh:** we need proven research to drive the parameters  

**Matt Garrish:** wcag may not have an easy answer on this for us  
… and what does it mean to users? If we say that it has a sound hazard, there are a variety of ways that users could be affected (i.e. seizures? damage hearing?)  
… what does it mean to users?  
… more work to be done in this area  

**Bill Kasdorf:** I bet there's an authoritative place to define issues like this (e.g. audiology)  
… we should rely on those sources rather than try to strike out on our own  

**Avneesh Singh:** for now we cannot provide the necessary parameters  
… if wcag comes back with answer, then great  
… but with the knowledge we have now, we should maintain the status quo  
… my preference would be if the WAI work on this on the level of the broader W3C, instead of making this an epub a11y thing  

**George Kerscher:** i think that is the right approach, but i would expect that audiobook publishers and publishers in general would look to us first and not go digging around in wcag  
… if we put informative information, even though we can't point to the research, i think that would benefit people  

**Avneesh Singh:** is something like that already in the spec?  
… examples, patterns etc?  

**Matt Garrish:** there are very general descriptions of hazardous audio, but we don't have references to anything specific where people can go to get more info  
… e.g. there was reference in the issue to a standard to define what "loud" meant  

**Avneesh Singh:** George_ you can go through what we have currently in the spec  
… the agenda also lists a number of issues that mgarrish has closed since last meeting  
… we can comment on those right now, or you can put your comments in the issue tracker
