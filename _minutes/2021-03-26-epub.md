**Dave Cramer:** I believe we have a new member of the wg?  

**Dan Fauxsmith:** I work at google. Have a diverse background. Not an epub expert yet. But I worked as designer and a technical writer. Have worked tangentially in publishing.  
… interested in the cross platform compatibility of epubs  

### 1. PR Clarifying non-linear items 
{: #section1}

_See github pull request [#1584](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1584)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1584 -->



_See github issue [#1480](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1480)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1480 -->



**Dave Cramer:** much of what we are talking about is in the comment to this issue  
… there is some history to `linear=no`  
… items are `linear=yes` when they are in reading order  
… but we don't say what to do when linear=no  
… most common implementation seems to have `linear=no` content only appear when link is clicked  
… belief that that content can be suppressed, but we wanted to clarify that that content must be reachable if explicitly clicked  

**Brady Duga:** `linear=no` was put in for publishers, to better control what RSes was doing with order of their content  

**Dave Cramer:** one of the issues was with cover images right? sometimes in the spine, sometimes in metadata?  

**Brady Duga:** no, this was more about content at the end, e.g. footnotes  
… where each footnote is in its own document, but only linked to the main book, not in reading order  
… so without linear the footnotes would sometimes appear in random order at the end of the book  

**Dave Cramer:** i think some RS will also just move all linear=no content at the end regardless  

**Ivan Herman:** just to clarify, e.g. i have a complex illustration that i don't want in the text, like an svg, and there is a reference to it, is this an example of `linear=no`?  

**Brady Duga:** if you have a link to that from something in your spine, then yes, that would be a use for linear=no  

**Dave Cramer:** and in some RS clicking that sort of link would open that content in a window in front of the text  

**Brady Duga:** its essentially metadata about this piece of content that enables RS to make informed decision about how to process this piece of content in its UI  

**Charles LaPierre:** we just had a example where extended image descriptions were marked as linear=no and but some RSes were still showing it where it appeared in the spine  
… this was kind of counter intuitive  

**Brady Duga:** if its a link then it has to show up in the spine, so RSes that want to show it know where to do so  
… this kind of goes back to the ideological debate of whether ebooks should replicate limitations of print  
… some RS are going to show all content, and some won't  
… linear doesn't change that  
… it just allows publishers to have some control over whether it appears at the back of the book vs some other location  

**Matt Garrish:** from a RS "make it render consistently" point of view, I'm not sure we can solve that  
… from a user perspective, that's why we wanted to give users an option to skip linear=no content or not  

**Dave Cramer:** there's so much existing content that i'm not sure there is a path towards uniform behaviour of the linear attribute  
… that said, i think the clarifying language of the PR is good  
… just underlining that RS must still show linear=no content if the user clicks a link  
… and not just suppress that content  

**Ivan Herman:** the current text uses a lot of MAYs  
… i just want to be sure that this is as far as we can go  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** in Readium community (Thorium etc.), we decided 3 years ago that if something is marked as linear=no then you won't encounter if you're just moving forward through a pub, but that you will see it if accessed via a link  
… this was not a hard decision  
… but how do you present these resources?  
… some people think that linear=no resource should behave like the rest of the content (i.e. if everything is normally paginated, then it should also be paginated)  
… but it could also be scrolled etc.  
… it may not be wg's role to deal with this, but it is a problem lacking a solution  
… even when we simply the scenario, by excluding desktop user case, for example, there is still disagreement about what to do with it  

**Ivan Herman:** so, the maximum we can do at this point in terms of the PR is to say yes, but i don't know whether we are in position to put the various alternatives of what can happen (along the lines of what Hadrien just discussed)  
… but that can be a separate issue  
… and maybe have it somewhere in spec as note  
… as it currently stands, you are in for a surprise, not even sure what behaviour to expect  

**Wendy Reid:** we get very similar comments about how we handle footnotes  
… need clarity about what to do with content that is linked from main text, but not necessarily required for main text  
… e.g. is it a pop-up, or does the link take you somewhere else, etc.  

**Dave Cramer:** can we resolve on accepting PR?

### 2. Data URLs PR 
{: #section2}

_See github pull request [#1582](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1582)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1582 -->



_See github issue [#1564](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1564)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1564 -->



**Matt Garrish:** this is from what we discussed last week's call  
… where do we allow data URLs, etc.  
… browsers are starting to disallow navigation to data URLs (to circumvent security issues)  
… so last week we said we would follow that path, but still allow embedding content via data URLs  
… plus we were going to say that we wouldn't allow data URLs as spine docs  
… how to phrase this was kind of complicated  
… the language uses "top level browsing"  
… but some RSes don't use a browser based model  
… so we say that in those cases, they still have to treat the data URLs similar to the way that a browser would  

**Brady Duga:** its hard to get the language right so that we don't disallow things by mistake, or allow things by mistake  
… e.g. when an RS wants to provide the ability to let user pop out content embedded via data URL in a separate window  
… wonder if there is another group working on specifying how this should work?  
… or are we on the bleeding edge here? Would rather not be the ones who set this standard  

**Matt Garrish:** this very much seems to be raised and discussed in the browser realm  
… potentially a part of the HTML spec  
… but nothing I can point to specifically  

**Ivan Herman:** this PR does a lot that is not contentious, i think  
… i propose to merge PR as it is, subject to the nitty gritty about the exact terminology  
… but then open an issue saying that this terminology still has to be checked with TAG and HTML community  
… and link to our language  
… that way we specifically flag this for TAG input  
… the new issue would be more focused  
… and in the meantime we capture everything else in the PR  

**Matt Garrish:** in that light, do we maybe want to keep the authoring side requirements, but leave out the RS expectations side?  

**Ivan Herman:** pref trying to do something now, even with it being incomplete, raise a separate issue about the terminology, link that issue to the text and ask for external help, e.g., from the TAG.  

**Brady Duga:** would refer this to TAG, yes  

**Ivan Herman:** also, let's mark issues as explicitly "referred to TAG for input"  

**Dave Cramer:** i'm okay with merging for now, on understanding that this is not final final

### 3. Extending "role" cardinality in contributor metadata 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#1129](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1129), [#1583](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1583)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1129 w3c/epub-specs/1583 -->



**Dave Cramer:** this came up early in epub 3.2 in CG  
… can you have more than one metaproperty role pointing to meta element  
… schema said 0 or 1  
… CG felt it would be tricky for RS to do anything else, and there wasn't a lot of demand for change at the time  
… but recently people have been using role property to reflect fact that each contributor can do multiple things for publication  

**Matt Garrish:** part of the restriction is because we had the OPF role attribute role in epub  
… and we were trying to match things up  
… i'm not sure its critical anyway  
… not harmful to have multiple roles  
… happy to let people do what they want with metadata  
… for epub2 compat, maybe an informative note that you may want to limit yourself to 1 role  

**Dave Cramer:** more RS i'm aware of won't display this to end user at all  

**Bill Kasdorf:** allowing this might be good just for removing friction for publishers  
… really common  
… so maybe let's allow it if it does no harm  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** from Readium perspective, we could support it  
… we could parse it, make it easy to work with, and then its up to the RS to do with that what they want  
… and then about OPF, for some RSes its the only metadata they have  

**Dan Fauxsmith:** given that we are currently saying 0 to 1, but publishers are saying they have lots of ebooks where this is already >1, should we recommend that if there is more than 1 then it should be in priority order?  
… as an author, you don't know about RS behaviour. You just want to know what is the best value to populate  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1 to dlazin

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** my Q is about ONIX  
… in ONIX do you have to duplicate the contributor, or can the contributor have multiple roles?  

**Bill Kasdorf:** this is really common in higher ed publishing  
… highly likely that they'd need to be able to do this  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** disagree that we should try to align with ONIX  
… its not produced by the same people  
… one person does OPF, and often someone else does ONIX  
… repeating roles rather than repeating author is more elegant  

**Dave Cramer:** ONIX cardinality for contributor is that each can have multiple roles  
… i'm seeing strong support to relax this restriction, to allow cardinality of multiple  

**Ivan Herman:** agree, but i think we should also make it clear that they should be in priority order  

**Charles LaPierre:** i just created book for diagram center that had multiple contributors, and there i had to add in all these roles for each contributor. Would have loved to have been able to do this in the epub as well.  

**Brady Duga:** for priority, i could seen some RS taking the first one, and some taking the last one  

**Matt Garrish:** can we also agree to 1583?

**Wendy Reid:** so we'll leave to mgarrish to draft amending language  

#### 3.1. referral to epubcheck
{: #section3-1}

**George Kerscher:** does this trigger a change to our schemas, and who if so, who does that?  

**Matt Garrish:** there's going to be a need to change epubcheck, yes  

**Ivan Herman:** let's let Romain, etc. know  

**Wendy Reid:** there's a corresponding issue in epubcheck repo  

**Ivan Herman:** so let's comment in their issue to let them know the resolution here?  

**Wendy Reid:** i'll do that yes, once we have the comment with the resolution in  

**Avneesh Singh:** about epubcheck, this change is for epub 3.3, but epubcheck is on epub 3.2 right now  
… so we'd have to request an exception to epub 3.2 compliance  

**Dave Cramer:** can we do an errata to 3.2 or.... Ivan?  

**Ivan Herman:** that goes a little beyond the current topic  
… not sure that this should be an exception  
… we've already made changes to media type, security related issues, that are very much on the same level  
… perhaps some epubcheck issues could be tagged that they've already been changed in 3.3  
… and then leave it up to epubcheck group to determine how they want to handle that  

**Avneesh Singh:** e.g. in prior spec, when we changed requirement related to order of toc, we discovered that this caused issues for jp publishers  
… in that case we made a special request for epubcheck to deviate from spec  

**Ivan Herman:** i don't think we should be prescribing to epubcheck how to prioritize their tasks  

**Avneesh Singh:** agreed, this wg just provides recommendations  

**Ivan Herman:** we've been fairly good in documenting our decision making, maybe this is enough of a basis for epubcheck to make a decision...  

**Matt Garrish:** i've been flagging things as changed already when i remember to  

**Ivan Herman:** okay, then we should be good  

**Dave Cramer:** right, thanks everyone for coming!  
… see you all next week
