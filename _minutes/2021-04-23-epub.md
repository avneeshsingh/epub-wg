### 1. i18n Issues
{: #section1}

> *Dave Cramer:* [https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1628](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1628)

#### 1.1. CSS files encoding 
{: #section1-1}

_See github issue [#1628](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1628)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1628 -->



_See github pull request [#1645](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1645)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1645 -->



**Dave Cramer:** first, encoding of CSS files  
… we say CSS files must be encoded in UTF8 or UTF16  
… web is leaning towards UTF8 for everything  
… i18n WG suggests we use UTF8 for everything  
… but some existing epubs might already use UTF16  
… proposal would deprecate UTF16 CSS files  
… issue is the epubcheck would be obligated to display warning if it found UTF16 CSS  
… not sure how big of a thing this is  
… CSS WG has recommended UTF16 in past  
… i'm okay with deprecating UTF16  
… the proposed phrasing is in the issue  

**Ivan Herman:** not sure how much books currently use UTF16, but epubcheck having to warn about this means that some changes will have to be made to epubcheck  
… but this isn't too big an obstacle  
… there is already a [PR](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1645)  
… ready to go  
… it keeps the current sentence but adds "but UTF16 is deprecated"  
… also, the exact same thing is happening in the spec for XML char encoding  
… so the PR makes the conforming change to XML too  

**Matt Garrish:** i'm not sure how much epubcheck even looks at CSS  
… we've talked about deprecating UTF16 before, but we opted to keep it at the time for backwards compatibility reasons  

**Brady Duga:** are there enough positive benefits to go ahead with this?  
… also, deprecation feels like it should be a statement of intent (i.e. that we will remove in future), but the truth is that we intend to keep this compatibility forever  

**Dave Cramer:** we're trying to work with i18n WG  

**Brady Duga:** is it deprecated in CSS?  

**Dave Cramer:** they say you SHOULD use UTF8  

**Brady Duga:** i would say "you should use UTF8", but i'm not sure about deprecating UTF16  

**Ivan Herman:** i suspect there are tools and scripts which simply do not work with UTF16  
… so we minimize the chance of people trying to use UTF16 CSS epubs with these tools  

**Brady Duga:** i'd be surprised if there are a lot of tools out there that don't support both encodings  

**Matt Garrish:** we are trying to align with the web, and what the other specs are saying  
… i.e. guiding people towards only using UTF8  

**Dave Cramer:** i understand the concerns with deprecation  
… we could say CSS must be either UTF8 or UTF16, but it should be UTF8  

**Matt Garrish:** that puts us more or less back in the same place, there's going to be an epubcheck warning  

**Dave Cramer:** and then people also have to go look up the definition of "deprecated", so maybe not saying that is more straightforward  

**Ivan Herman:** for sake of argument, Rust for example, which is gaining popularity, only uses UTF8

#### 1.2. Length of file and path names 
{: #section1-2}

_See github issue [#1629](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1629)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1629 -->



**Dave Cramer:** file names must not exceed 255B, path name not more than 65535B  
… so what happens if these limits are exceeded?  
… my initial reaction is to say if you have some massively long file name and the RS knows what to do, then I don't think we should ask RS to fail artificially  

**Dan Lazin:** so maybe, "file names must abide, if not RS must truncate"?  

**Matt Garrish:** we've talked about this in the past  
… truncation leads to having to modify all the content  
… but then how we enforce?  
… maybe we could point to a method of truncation that RS can use  
… but at best this is note territory  
… we shouldn't specify normative stuff to address this  

**Dave Cramer:** basically if you go outside of what the rules are, things may break  
… if the file names are truncated, the RS may not know what to do, may not be able to identify the file  

**Charles LaPierre:** as long as epubcheck throws an error for long file names, most distributors won't accept those epubs  
… most people won't see those books  

**Ivan Herman:** a few weeks ago we had a discussion like this about content document processing (see [spec intro for content docs](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/#sec-contentdocs))  
… i think we should use the same text for the package document processing  
… this is all the same sort of thing, where spec says what you should do, and we're concerned with what RS should do if content does not conform  
… if we change our mind here, then we should go back and change what we did for content document processing too  

**Dave Cramer:** can we just say that if RS encounters file name or path exceeding limit that it should try to process it?  
… and if it fails then it doesn't have to do anything else?  
… i.e. no obligation to truncate, but continue to process if it can  

**Brady Duga:** we don't say what RS should do, so whether I try to continue to process or not, I'd be in spec  
… let's just explicitly say that RS should try  

**Matt Garrish:** should there be a note as well that if you try truncation, then you may have to go into the content as well?  
… should we note the problems with truncation?  

**Dave Cramer:** i think we're kind of dealing with that by advising people not to use long file names in the first place  
… but no strong feelings, either way  

**Wendy Reid:** okay, so we're leaving in the requirement about file name size  

**Ivan Herman:** in the issue, Fuxiao gave i18n link that says spec should not try to limit length of names  

**Brady Duga:** good point  
… if you are JP using UTF8, that's really not a lot of characters  
… maybe we should just follow whatever the zip specification says and not add extra requirements  

**Matt Garrish:** these requirements exist to try to maintain cross-compat  
… we don't want to be creating OS-based compatibility issues  
… i'm concerned about dropping these requirements  

**Brady Duga:** i think the 255B number is based on some legacy system (e.g. Pascal)  
… somewhat arbitrary to enforce this today  

**Dave Cramer:** isn't this a limit of Windows? Not a limit of winzip or the zip spec?  

**Brady Duga:** Mac paths apparently have a limit of 260 char, not byte  

**Dave Cramer:** i am fine with keeping the limit in order to make epubs more universal  
… maybe just add something that says RS should still try to process document if it encounters file name or path exceeding limits

#### 1.3. Case folding of the file names 
{: #section1-3}

_See github issue [#1631](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1631)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1631 -->



**Dave Cramer:** "file names must be unique following case normalization"  

**Matt Garrish:** i think Addison's note (in issue) about case folding is fine  
… he also asked why we have a SHOULD for normalization, but a MUST for case folding  
… not sure how to deal with these  

**Dave Cramer:** i think we can have MUST for both?  
… would we have something about which algorithm we're using?

#### 1.4. Character restrictions on the file names 
{: #section1-4}

_See github issue [#1632](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1632)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1632 -->



**Dave Cramer:** character restrictions on file names  
… there were typos  
… already a PR in to fix those  
… i think all we have to do is resolve to accept the PR here  

**Matt Garrish:** the typo PR was already merged, actually  

**Dave Cramer:** as far as i know, we now ban all non-characters  

**Matt Garrish:** yes  
… Fuxiao is asking why we banned certain parts of the Arabic Presentation Forms, but not other unassigned chars in other blocks  

**Dave Cramer:** and I answered that the Arabic Presentation Forms thing was because those were non-characters  
… we haven't said anything about unassigned character blocks  

**Ivan Herman:** we should ping Fuxiao to ask if it is okay to close the issue now  

**Dave Cramer:** do we need to resolve to close issue?  

**Ivan Herman:** I think we should, because we asked i18n WG

### 2. xpointer shorthand for fragment identifiers too restrictive? 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1586](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1586)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1586 -->



**Dave Cramer:** does anybody know why we referenced xpointer in the first place?  

**Matt Garrish:** maybe they were trying to make sure it was a CFI?  
… but we've since thought about allowing CFIs  

**Brady Duga:** does XHTML still require NCNames?  

**Matt Garrish:** no  
… can follow up with Marisa and Daniel?  
… to clarify intent here  

**Dave Cramer:** agree  

**Ivan Herman:** I propose we table the container constrained scripts to next time  

### 3. TF review
{: #section3}

**Wendy Reid:** FXL TF, ken put together notes on review of Daisy KB  
… also started working on outline for best practices doc  
… virtual locators have reviewed CFI as solution  
… looking at use-cases to make documentation more clear  
… CFI seems to do most of what we want, but we also need CFIs to be something more human readable  

**Ivan Herman:** for both TF, are we heading at some features that might influence the normative specs? Or are we producing additional documents?  

**Wendy Reid:** for FXL, we're looking at producing a WG note, and then updating things in Daisy KB  
… for virtual locators, we're not currently making normative changes, but we've not taken that off the table  
… maybe as simple as elevating CFI to WG level  

**Ivan Herman:** is the FXL being just a note good enough for the a11y community compared to all the normative things we have in the normative document  

**Wendy Reid:** none of the best practice statements are going to be normative  
… we're just reiterating best practices from existing spec (maybe with references to those spec)  

**Ivan Herman:** still kind of unclear about FXL being on the side when we have a separate a11y spec on rec track  

**Matt Garrish:** its like the a11y techniques document, which will be a note  

**Ivan Herman:** that means that whatever discussion they have on FXL will not influence any statement in core a11y spec?  

**Matt Garrish:** yes  

**Ivan Herman:** so, why not merge this with the a11y techniques document?  

**Matt Garrish:** i assume this would be more focused on FXL, rather than having it mixed up with general a11y best practice  

**Ivan Herman:** concerned that this will confuse users  

**Matt Garrish:** we can clarify in the documents
