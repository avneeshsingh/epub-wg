### 1. TF updates
{: #section1}

_See github pull request [#1654](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1654), [#1652](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/pull/1652)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1654 w3c/epub-specs/1652 -->



**Wendy Reid:** both TFs met this week  
… FXL TF talked about next steps for best practices, and for experiments  
… gpelligrino and I working on experiments  
… virtual locators TF discussed use-cases  
… moving ahead with CFI  
… narrowing down use-cases to identify how specific we have to be in turning CFI into something human readable  
… also taking CFI from IDPF space to WG note  
… that's the 2nd PR  
… it will make it easier to comment and track changes  

**Dave Cramer:** okay to merge now?  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, unless there is any reason not to  
… they are pretty harmless, just adding documentation to github  

### 2. xpointer shorthand 
{: #section2}

_See github issue [#1586](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1586)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1586 -->



**Dave Cramer:** this was about using xpointer shorthand as identifiers in MO spec  
… xpointer defines all sorts of different fragment identifier schemes  
… do any implementations of MO use anything other than HTML `#id`?  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** not that I know  

**Dave Cramer:** yes, that matches my experience too  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** the intention in MO was to say "refer to fragment identifier"  
… what happened was that that idea got formalized into xpointer shorthand  
… it was a suggestion from JP reviewers of epub 3  
… but intention was not changed  

**Dave Cramer:** so we were trying to find a stable spec reference to reflect that concept  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** yes  

**Dave Cramer:** and these were also more XML centric times  
… i think its worth exploring a simply way of expressing this without misleading authors that they can use anything in xpointer  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** yes. I think encouraging ease of use will increase adoption  

**Dave Cramer:** when Microsoft was trying to implement epub in Edge, they had questions about this use of xpointer too  

**Wendy Reid:** was there a MO test in the old epubtest?  

**Marisa DeMeglio:** yes, it was massive and hard to pass test  
… but that old site isn't really up to date  

**Dave Cramer:** but i think there are quite a few implementations of MO  
… but this is enough info to move forward on the issue  
… I'll assign myself to find a better spec reference for what we are trying to say about fragment identifiers  

### 3. SHOULD for "valid language tags" 
{: #section3}

_See github issue [#1509](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1509)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1509 -->



**Dave Cramer:** during i18n review, we saw that some specs use SHOULD for validity of language tags  
… we don't say anything about validity  
… and we had a previous resolution to close issue without forcing validity  
… part of consideration was not increasing complexity for epubcheck  
… I also feel this will affect a diminishing number of epubs that have well formed yet invalid lang tags  
… given that RS don't tend to do much that lang tag info anyway  

**Ben Schroeter:** can we clarify difference?  

**Dave Cramer:** it follows the normal pattern e.g. `en-US`  
… `qq-ZQ` would also be well formed, if most likely invalid  

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** if RS cannot recognize the tag, its still okay in many cases  
… so i think validation is not mandatory

### 4. RS handling of non-Arabic page numbers in pagelist 
{: #section4}

_See github issue [#1505](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1505)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1505 -->



**Dave Cramer:** this came up because gregorio asking about rules for non-Arabic page numbers  
… answer seemed to be that there are no rules  
… pagelist is just list of links, authors choose how to label those links  
… issue discussion started to revolve around counter systems used around the world  
… but this seems like an aside  

**Brady Duga:** also, we have no rules for Arabic page numbers either  
… we have no rules for page numbers, period  

**Dave Cramer:** maybe we could recommend that if RS choose to display numbers from pagelist, that RS should display the values chosen by author  
… e.g. where author has carefully chosen the type and sequence of page numbers  

**Brady Duga:** agree (also, it seems obvious that RS shouldn't do stuff like that)  

**Dave Cramer:** yes, and also, the original concern seems somewhat theoretical

### 5. Handling gaps in pagelist 
{: #section5}

_See github issue [#1504](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/issues/1504)._

<!-- issue w3c/epub-specs/1504 -->



**Dave Cramer:** question of whether RS should interpolate between explicit page numbers if it encountered gaps  
… e.g. where an epub without page numbers was remediated by adding page references to only the first page of each chapter  
… if the RS even allowed a user to "go to" page and user entered in a number in one of the gaps  
… i would expect RS to say "page does not exist"  
… interpolation does not seem a workable solution  

**Brady Duga:** yes, that's what Google does  
… if you enter something that doesn't match a pagelist value, we don't go anywhere  
… if you enter a match, then we take you to the destination of the pagelist  

**Ben Schroeter:** what about gregorio's question about guidance to authors to include pagelist link to all pages  

**Brady Duga:** there might be pages in the print that are not in epub, blank pages, out of order pages (i.e. frontmatter moved to back)  
… numerous reasons for lack of 1-to-1 correspondence

> *Wendy Reid:* +1

> *Matthew Chan:* +1

> *Toshiaki Koike:* +1

> ***Resolution #3: Close issue 1504***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Dave Cramer:** some of this may be best practice for how to create pagelist, but that's outside scope of core spec  

> *Matthew Chan:* shiestyle addresses JP members in Japanese

**Shinya Takami (高見真也):** I just confirmed whether Voyager is using pagelist  
… i don't think many JP RS do  

### 6. F2F Dates
{: #section6}

**Wendy Reid:** we settled on may 27/28  
… we have only just started talking about the agenda  
… so please raise issues that are worthwhile for the whole group  
… they are a good opportunity for us to connect with other W3C WG for cross-over issues  
… e.g. the mini-apps WG  
… may invite them for at least part of one of the days  
… our main agenda idea is to tackle the ["list of issues"](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/wiki/Big-Issues-for-EPUB-3.3)  
… e.g., the scripting meeting would probably be a F2F topic  

**Dan Lazin:** i would like to talk about dark mode  
… this disproportionately affects epub, and is also widely implemented  

**Dave Cramer:** also one of the most jarring things in epub, often not well implemented  

**Wendy Reid:** please keep sending in agenda item ideas  

**Dave Cramer:** F2F is also better for longer issues that don't fit well into the weekly 1hr format  

**Wendy Reid:** so it'll be 2 three hour meetings, with breaks  
… one at this time slot, and with the next day being the other time slot  

### 7. AOB?
{: #section7}

**Dave Cramer:** okay, thanks everyone  
… see you all on github
