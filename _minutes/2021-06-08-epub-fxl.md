> *Wendy Reid:* [https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y/](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/fxl-a11y/)

**Wendy Reid:** update: the outline document has now been updated with content  
… there are some issues with markdown (esp. with images), but otherwise it seems to be working  

> *Ken Jones:* [https://demo.colibrio.com/?publication_url=https://www.circularsoftware.com/samples/DonKomarechka/macro-book-48pp-section_IDexport.epub](https://demo.colibrio.com/?publication_url=https://www.circularsoftware.com/samples/DonKomarechka/macro-book-48pp-section_IDexport.epub)

**Ken Jones:** i've got some sample content that i mentioned last week from Don Komarechka  
… should be viewable in your browser  
… its got double columns, technical illustrations (e.g. comparative images, table as an image)  
… pg 380 has a full-bleed two-page image  
… might be interesting to work on together, to put into good reading order, with descriptions  
… right now it has come straight out of INDD  
… this is just a section, but we are allowed to use as much of it as we want  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, some of these will be good examples for demonstrating techniques  

**Charles LaPierre:** on the tables, our recommendation has always been to take out the image and create the equivalent table with CSS styling  
… for more complicated tables a solution is to have a link out to a separate page with a full-blown table, and then with link back to the main book content  

**Rachel Osolen:** agree, and I can help with examples of alt-text  
… and there is also already good documentation about how to describe images in a series, and how to describe images in a spread  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, the tables documentation somewhat bled over into alt-text  
… so the next section we should write is a comprehensive guide on how to write alt-text  

**Rachel Osolen:** i can take that on, and anyone who wants to help is welcome  

**Charles LaPierre:** I can help. Diagram Center has lots of examples. We have an image description sample book that we did with help from BrailleNet  
… we also have POET, which is a training guide for writers of alt-text  

**Ken Jones:** should we choose this document to make as fully accessible as we can?  
… so how about we draft some alt-text for this document?  

**Wendy Reid:** both. We want to have the guidance document explain how to write, and then refer to our examples  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** I would focus on making it accessible from HTML and CSS point of view, but not focus so much on the content  
… the actual text descriptions might be a little out of scope. We're not advising on how to create tech to write alt-text  

**Rachel Osolen:** We should focus on FXL. And there are resources out there for cases where there are full page images across spread, images of text, images with text embedded alongside complex diagrams  

**Charles LaPierre:** we can have best practices reflected with examples drawn from multiple different types of sources (children's books, cookbook, etc.)  
… and then we should also have an actual epub containing all the examples  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** at DeMarque, we see a lot of comics/manga, then children's, then non-fiction/cookbooks, etc.  
… as a group are we strictly trying to address the best practice sorts of things, or if we are trying to tackle some of the more difficult genres?  
… e.g. for manga, just alt-text wouldn't work  
… in some of our past meetings we talked about alternate style sheets  
… this wouldn't work for the most complex cases either, and it is also problematic from RS perspective, as we don't have the ability to trigger these alternate CSS  
… one possible solution is to have spine alternates  
… this seems easiest to implement from RS perspective  
… where does the group stand on that?  

**Wendy Reid:** we're talking about alternate CSS, but it doesn't differ too much from spine alternates, but because its still so early in our design, we haven't been very specific yet  
… this is still very open to discussion  
… re. comics, agreed that it is very complex in terms of formatting, and there's much more to discuss there  

**Charles LaPierre:** on the manga and comics, do we have any leads on getting example content?  
… and does the flow change (e.g. can it go from left to right to vertical, are there other types of reading orders?)  

**Wendy Reid:** yes, reading directionality of the page can change from page to page, subject to a general flow (either left to right, or right to left)  

**Ken Jones:** i've started writing the section on navigation, and there's region-based navigation that is in the standard, but little supported  
… we could talk about using that to guide reading?  

> *Ken Jones:* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%26Carrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%26Carrot)

**Ken Jones:** would help with small screen reading, and visually impaired reading  
… link is to free comic that we can draw examples from  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** region-based is part of spec, but its also mostly implemented by Barnes and Noble, maybe one other  
… it relied a lot on renditions, separate XML documents, and was never widely adopted for authoring  
… region-based navigation is widely relied upon, but everyone does it in their own separate way  
… the spec method is complicated, and maybe relies too much on multiple renditions  
… also, maybe not much desire to standardize out in industry today  

**Wendy Reid:** agree, spec is complicated, especially for authoring  
… tools are not widely available  

**Charles LaPierre:** a group at Benetech India is augmenting children's picture books by augment each page with audio on each page  
… the human narration also includes the alt-text  
… we could mention that as a solution  

**Ken Jones:** in the same way that film can also be audio described, maybe that would be a solution for comics  

**Gregorio Pellegrino:** one issue is that we'd be imposing a reading order. It works for video, but in a comic book this is not so. Readers find it important that they can choose the order  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** not sure I agree. We're talking about adapting content, which involves interpretation.  
… so for comic, each page could have HTML with semantic structure to indicate where you are  
… it could also be used to provide information to RS, which could provide context  
… but it would be a lot of work for the author  

**Ken Jones:** comics are story-based, which usually do have a logical sequence  

**Wendy Reid:** has NNELS ever had comics requested?  

**Rachel Osolen:** I wrote a paper on this topic, and we have staff that are avid comics readers, so inside NNELS we've been discussing this topic  
… I can link to resources  
… there are people out there outside of the WGs that are working on innovative ways to make comics more accessible  
… the presentation I'm referring to also has first hand accounts of difficulties that readers are actually having with comics  
… at the time we were working within the confines of creating a DAISY book  
… so our research was about how to narrate visually-driven content  
… and there's been a lot of work done on web comics  
… mostly by way of how to draft text alternatives  
… and then there's a company working on making that text alternative navigable  

**Wendy Reid:** link above is to a comic that is accessible via a number of different modalities (closed captioning, high contrast, translations, change text size)  
… author felt that it was a cool experiment, but that it was a lot of work  
… unsure that it was workable for a whole book  
… we might not be able to do complete what this example implements, but we could take some ideas  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** most of the time this content is produced in bitmaps, and there is not a lot of work done in terms of structure beyond reading order  
… even pagelists are sometimes not very useful in these types of books  
… but to have something that is widely adopted, it must be compatible with this sort of workflow  
… and it would have to be able to be added to this workflow at the end  
… there is a spec called [Media Fragments](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-frags/) at W3C, which allows you to refer to a rectangle in an image  
… you can image left and right pages, but with TTS to read the HTML content and with media fragments to locate the HTML within the image  
… advantage of this is that it relies on existing web-technology without creating anything new  
… and it doesn't require authors to change the way they author  

**Wendy Reid:** our documentation is primarily aimed at guiding the primary authoring stage, since we want people to start thinking about accessibility, but it can also guide processing the results of authoring  
… I also want to experiment with web technology like grid, flexbox, or even media fragments to see what can be done  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** with my RS hat on, there's still a lot of inconsistency in terms of how to implement FXL  
… I see that being an issue  
… anything that doesn't change the way FXL is handled, but is more of an addition, has a better chance of uptake  

**Wendy Reid:** so Rachel_Osolen and CharlesL will work on alt-text best practices section  
… we're going to use Ken_Jones's sample from the photography book, we probably want to pull out some representative pages (e.g. one with the table, page 37 with the group of images)  
… Ken_Jones to work on navigation section  

> *Hadrien Gardeur:* "Page Blanche" could be used as a sample as well: [https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples/tree/main/30/page-blanche](https://github.com/IDPF/epub3-samples/tree/main/30/page-blanche)

**Wendy Reid:** I will try to get my hand on more sample comics content (maybe with more complex formatting)  
… and we also still have the experiments  

**Ken Jones:** looking at the media fragments, they seem similar to region-based navigation  
… is there something about sync navigation that also integrates with region-based navigation  
… they're both existing web technology  

**Hadrien Gardeur:** region-based navigation was informed by media fragments, and extended  

> *Matthew Chan:* media-fragments can only be rectangles, but region-based navigation can have different shapes

**Hadrien Gardeur:** but region-based navigation isn't widely implemented, where as media-fragments is used (e.g. by [IIIF](https://iiif.io/))  
… in that way media-fragments aligns more closely with the web  

**Wendy Reid:** AOB?  

**Ken Jones:** would alt-text be enough to describe each fragment? Or would there also be a description of the overall scene?  

**Charles LaPierre:** I think that would be the bare minimum for WCAG A, but we could raise the bar by adding a scene description, but it really does depend on the page  
… there are some pages where just describing the fragments could lose some of the meaning in the context  

**Rachel Osolen:** for comics, one thing i've found is that you do need that extra level of the scene description  
… this is the way that NNELS has approached it: 1) whole page, 2) each panel, 3) and then try to break apart each panel  
… there's a lot of additional information in the scene that is relevant to comics, such as the size of the panel, shape of panel, border, positioning, etc.  

**Charles LaPierre:** the author's notes to the illustrator are super important for describing comics. Would be great to have these, but difficult to get  

**Ken Jones:** do we have samples of any of these?  

**Rachel Osolen:** these are more experiments, I could share those  
… I can also share the paper I wrote related to the DAISY comic book  
… and I'll also reach out to that company working on navigation by headings for comics  

**Ken Jones:** is ARIA `describedby` something we can use, potentially for scene descriptions  

**Charles LaPierre:** there's ARIA details that is starting to get some support, `describedby` is not what we want here because that strips out all the HTML semantics, i think  

**Wendy Reid:** `describedby` stores an ID to some other HTML element  
… you do lose some semantics in doing that  

**Charles LaPierre:** same idea with ARIA `labelledby`  

**Wendy Reid:** okay, you have some tasks, we'll talk again in 2 weeks  
… thank you all for coming!
