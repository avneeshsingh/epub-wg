<h1>[Draft] First Public Working Draft: EPUB 3.3</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB 3 Working Group</a> has published four First Public Working Drafts today for EPUB&nbsp;3.3. This technology defines a distribution and interchange format for digital publications and documents. The EPUB format provides a means of representing, packaging, and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including HTML, CSS, SVG, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file container.
</p>

<p>
    The specification represents the third major revision of the standard and, in particular, a revision of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/epub-spec.html">EPUB&nbsp;3.2 document</a> published by the EPUB 3 Community Group. This new version of the specification is now on a W3C Recommendation Track.
