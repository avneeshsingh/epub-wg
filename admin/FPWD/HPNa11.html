<h1>[Draft] First Public Working Draft: EPUB Accessibility 1.1</h1>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB 3 Working Group</a> has published a First Public Working Draft today for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/WD-epub-a11y-11-20210223/">EPUB&nbsp;Accessibility&nbsp;1.1</a>. This document specifies content conformance requirements for verifying the accessibility of EPUB Publications. It also specifies accessibility metadata requirements for the discoverability of EPUB Publications.
    The document takes an abstract approach to the accessibility requirements for EPUB Publications, similar to how WCAG&nbsp;2 separates its accessibility guidelines from the techniques to achieve them. This approach allows the guidelines to remain stable even as the format evolves.
</p>   

<p>
    To facilitate this approach, a companion <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-epub-a11y-tech-11-20210223/">EPUB Accessibility TechniquesÂ 1.1</a> has also been published today as a W3C WG Note, which outlines conformance techniques. These techniques explain how to meet the requirements of this document for different versions of EPUB.
