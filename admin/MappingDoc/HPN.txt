Subject: [DRAFT HPN] Working Group Note: EPUB Accessibility - EU Accessibility Act Mapping

----------------------------

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org//publishing/groups/epub-wg/">EPUB 3 Working Group</a> 
has just published a Working Group Note
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-epub-a11y-eaa-mapping-20210629/">EPUB Accessibility - EU Accessibility Act Mapping</a> document.
</p>

<p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019L0882">European Accessibility Act (EAA)</a> is an 
EU directive that establishes binding accessibility targets that must be met by many different types of products and
services to strengthen the rights of people with disabilities to access goods and services, including ebooks, dedicated
reading software, ereading devices, and ecommerce.</p>

<p>The EAA has been approved on 27 June  2019, should be implemented by EU Member States within 
28 June 2022 and will enter in force from 28 June 2025.</p>

<p>This note aims to demonstrate that the technical requirements of the European Accessibility
Act related to ebooks are met by the EPUB standard.</p>

<p>The methodology used is mapping the requirements of the EU Accessibility Act related to ebooks
to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-a11y-11/">EPUB Accessibility</a> specification.</p>
